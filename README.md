# **AP_Libs**  [![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/3ee80421ecf5410e912a0d9e48e9aa0c)](https://www.codacy.com/app/dedeswim/AP_Libs?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=dedeswim/AP_Libs&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

Some libraries for the _Advanced Programming_ exam in _Tongji University (Shanghai)_, but are good for every _Advanced Programming_ course or to know how to use some ADTs for personal interest.

There are:
- linked lists
- stacks
- queues
- hash tables
- sorting algorithms

Everything is tested and actually works.
Hope that the comments help you on understanding the code.
If you need to change the data type (obviously if it is a number or char type) change the `typedef int ADT_type` which is in the first lines of every `.h` file to `typedef _value_you _want_ ADT_type`.
If it is a string you need to add the memory allocation for the strings.

All the libraries are released under MIT license, so have fun!
